## To do next

[See Nextcloud Tasks](https://nextcloud.jackkershaw.pp.ua/apps/tasks/#/collections/today)

## Codewars Profile

- I like using Codewars to improve my Javascript and Python. You can see my progress on my profile [here](https://www.codewars.com/users/jones58)

## freeCodeCamp Profile

- I owe a lot of my learning to freeCodeCamp. After completing the [responsive web design certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/jones58/responsive-web-design), I had the confidence to work on my own sites. More recently I completed the [Javascript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/jones58/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures). You can see my progress through the freeCodeCamp curriculum [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/jones58).

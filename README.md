# my-coding-progress
Keeping track of my journey learning to code, from October 2022 - Now. Hope this can provide a loose guide, or inspire other learners.

I originally had this as one big readme but decided to migrate it to Eleventy (using it as a md to html converter) for a more accessible and well designed site, deployed as a subdomain on my site jackkershaw.net
